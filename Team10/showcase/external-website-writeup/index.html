                [text]="We noticed that the McMaster Carr website was very
            difficult to navigate and find the parts you need. It also
            had an error where if you have an empty cart and click
            order, it loads until a timeout then sends you to home page.
            The main issue is the ease of ordering on the website as we
            have multiple reports of ordering from McMaster-Carr's
            website being a hassle."

                [text]="We found that the website vercel.com was very clean and easy
            to navigate. A specific example is the navbar showing all
            the locations you would need for both information and
            purchasing. The website also makes its goal know at the
            beginning in the hero section of the website."
