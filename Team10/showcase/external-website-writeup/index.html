                <subtext
                    >We noticed that the McMaster Carr website was very
                    difficult to navigate and find the parts you need. It also
                    had an error where if you have an empty cart and click
                    order, it loads until a timeout then sends you to home page.
                    The main issue is the ease of ordering on the website as we
                    have multiple reports of ordering from McMaster-Carr's
                    website being a hassle.</subtext

                <h2>Vercel Website Writeup</h2>
                <subtext>
                    We found that the website vercel.com was very clean and easy
                    to navigate. A specific example is the navbar showing all
                    the locations you would need for both information and
                    purchasing. The website also makes its goal know at the
                    beginning in the hero section of the website.
